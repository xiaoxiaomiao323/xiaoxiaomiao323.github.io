<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an assistant professor at [Singapore Institute of Technology](https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/directory/faculty/xiaoxiao-miao) until July 2025 and will join [Duke KunShan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn) as a tenure-track assistant professor in August 2025. 
Prior to that, from 2021 to 2023, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institute of Informatics (NII), Japan, supervised by Prof [Junichi Yamagishi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nRrdjtwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
I received my Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences/University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 2021, supervised by Prof [Pengyuan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-Op9f5sAAAAJ&hl=en).
During 2018 and 2019, I was at the University of Kent, UK, as a Visiting Student, supervised by Prof [Ian McLoughlin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mcnKgPoAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interest includes speech security, speaker and language recognition, and machine learning. I am a co-organizer of the
[VoicePrivacy challenge](https://www.voiceprivacychallenge.org) 2022, 2024 and [Attacker Challenge at ICASSP 2025](https://www.voiceprivacychallenge.org/attacker/). My work has been published at the top international AI conferences and journals such as IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing (TASLP), IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (TIFS), Neural Networks, Computer Speech and Language (CSL), ICASSP, INTERSPEECH.
